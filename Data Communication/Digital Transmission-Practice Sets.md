# Digital Transmission-Practice Sets

## Questions

1. List three techniques of digital-to-digital conversion.
	1. Line Coding - Line coding is a process that involves converting a sequence of *binary data (0s and 1s) into a corresponding electrical or optical signal* suitable for transmission over a communication channel
	2. Block Coding - Block coding is a method of error detection and correction that involves adding extra bits to the original data before transmission
	3. Scrambling - Scrambling is a technique used to modify the original data sequence before transmission to mitigate specific issues associated with the transmitted signal. Scrambling is often employed to address problems like long runs of 0s or 1s in the data, which can lead to synchronization and timing issues
2. Distinguish between a signal element and a data element.
	1. 
3. Distinguish between data rate and signal rate.
4. Define baseline wandering and its effect on digital transmission.
5. Define a DC component and its effect on digital transmission.
6. Define the characteristics of a self-synchronizing signal.
7. List five line coding schemes discussed in this book.
8. Define block coding and give its purpose.
9. Define scrambling and give its purpose.
10. Compare and contrast PCM and DM.
11. What are the differences between parallel and serial transmission?
12. List three different techniques in serial transmission and explain the differences.
