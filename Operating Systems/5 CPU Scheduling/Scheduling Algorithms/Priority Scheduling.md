# Priority Scheduling

- A priority number (integer) is associated with each process
- The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority (smallest integer - highest priority)
- SJF is priority scheduling where priority is the inverse of predicted next CPU burst time
- Problem - Starvation–low priority processes may never execute
- Solution - Aging–as time progresses increase the priority of the process
